        <p>
          Todayâ€™s world is terribly difficult for musicians, performers, and starving artists. Finding work, building a fanbase and a network, financially supporting your art - these are all barriers to entry into the music industry. Music is a superstar economy and the top 1% dominate 77% of the market. There is a monopoly on sound!

The next biggest influences on building connections relied on the use of social media platforms for connecting with fans and streaming music to gain attraction.
