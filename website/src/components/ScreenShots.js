          <p className="">Tunite attempts to provide musicians with a tool that promotes new collaborations as well as highlight collaborations that are done well. By using Tunite, artists can share new music that has the potential to influence, motivate, or inspire the next, biggest hit. Music posted on this platform become open to the public for collaboration and the best collaborations become celebrated by the community.</p>
          <p className="">Collaborations are created by taking an existing song and sampling it, mixing it, or adding to it. New collaborations are easy to seek using the explore feature. When an artists posts a song, they can select a fifteen second snippet that advertises their version of a song. Then all collaborations from an original song become explorable by sifting through each songsâ€™ snippet. Intriguing songs can be saved to listen to later.</p>
